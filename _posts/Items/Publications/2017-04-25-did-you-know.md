Abortion is the leading cause of death among African Americans. Did You Know? is shattering the silence of this great tragedy. Written by African Americans for the African American community, Did You Know? contains powerful articles written by leaders such as Dr. Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Arnold Culbreath, Urban Outreach Director for Protecting Black Life, Dr. Johnny Hunter, National Director of Life Education and Research Network, Inc., and many others. 12 Pages.
