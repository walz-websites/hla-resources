Our Future in Peril details the staggering impact of abortion across the globe as well as the foundational reasons it is becoming so widespread. Endangered reaches out to men and women considering abortion and educates them on the humanity of the preborn child and the consequences of abortion for women and men. It also goes more in depth to examine forced abortion, maternal mortality, feminism, and the funders and providers of abortion. This publication is a great resource to be used around the world.
