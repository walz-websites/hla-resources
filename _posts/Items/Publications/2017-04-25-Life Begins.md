<p><b><i>Life Begins: An Amazing Adventure</i></b> is a comic book designed to teach children about the development of the preborn child. Lead by two adventurous narrators, Gus and Lila, Life Begins is a delightful walk through the first nine months of life. Children enjoy the antics of comical narrators while learning their first pro-life lesson—how a baby grows in her mother’s womb.</p>
